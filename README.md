# VBA-Challenge
Stock Market Analysis
In this Module we used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. 
To analyze this data we created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
the ticker symbol, yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, 
the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and the total stock volume of the stock. 
If you run this script yourself the results should match the images provided in the repository.
